title: Frontend Developer Goals
---
In order to be a solid frontend developer, dedication and patience are key qualities that are required. Having strong dedication to code and learn new methods to code will only help keep the learning the process moving. Patience makes coding much easier to manage when errors pop up. Without having patience, it becomes tedious and painful to code. My goal is to continue my dedication and patience to code in order to work towards my startup at some point next year. The world continues to change, and technology happens to be on front page of every change. Having frontend experience only helps market myself better when it comes to my competition. Being able to develop applications and explain the process technically is what I strive to achieve.
