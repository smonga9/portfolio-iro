The biggest challenge that I've had to face when learning to develop has been remediating errors in my code. It's been quite difficult to find some of the errors in my code. I've had my mentor help assist me whenever I've had trouble, but I've got be more independent moving forward. Beyond error identification, its important that I continue to go back and review past exercises to make sure some of the concepts that I've learnt continue to stick with me as I move forward within the curriculum.
