My experience at Bloc has been great so far. I'm almost through the frontend portion of the curriculum, and have learnt a lot throughout the process. I've had my struggles, and still require review of pass assignment to make sure that I understand all the concepts that the curriculum has provided so far. Having a strong and patient mentor has been super helpful throughout the process. Any questions or concerns I've had so far have been remediated without any issues. I look forward to completing the frontend portion of the curriculum, and moving on to the backend portion of the curriculum.
