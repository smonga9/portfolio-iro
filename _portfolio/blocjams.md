Case Study

Summary
In order to provide a solid impact towards the music industry, an efficient and sound music player was needed. The bloc jams project was a perfect starting point to utilize front-end coding languages such as Javascript and jQuery. The bloc jams projects provides insight on how to create a music player similar to Spotify.

Explanation
The users of the project would be individuals that have interest in different types of music. Stakeholders would be someone like myself who has created the website application, and individuals that would support the development of the application and potential funding moving forward.

Problem
Music players that have issues with buffering
Music players that have issues with efficient playback
Music players that can not sort songs based on user preferences
Music players that can switch between songs effectively

Solution
We were able to add functionality within our music player that prevented buffering and any issues with playback.
Also we add functionality based on mouse movements that would help switch between different songs. Algorithms were created in order to sort songs based on user preferences.

Results
Between each of the checkpoints we were able to test functionality for the following activities

Switching between songs
Switching between different webpages
Play/Pause songs
Music and Volume tool bars

Conclusion
At the end of the project, we were able to have sound music player that worked for one album, but had the ability to bring in more albums if necessary. I would focus more on my attention to detail to prevent potential bugs that impacted my coding efficiency.
